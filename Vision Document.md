# Dancer App & Dancer App Network

The Dancer App is an Android mobile phone application and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

The Dancer App Network is all participating verified dancer accounts ranked by a calculated score. This score is made up of verifications, number of badges and activity. The network of dancers is further grouped by zip code and venues the dancer is associated with. The rankings of dancers can be viewed or searched by a patron, dancer or venue account using either the Dancer App or any web browser.

A dancer in this context is an adult entertainer, otherwise known as a stripper or an exotic dancer. A venue is a club where dancers perform at. A patron is a venue customer who visits to see the dancer perform.

The purpose of the Dancer App is for dancers to promote themselves to patrons. It is also the purpose of the app to facilitate an in-app connection between the dancers and patrons. The purpose of this connection is to encourage the patron to visit the dancer at the venue.

Patrons can purchase in-app gifts for verified dancers called badges. These badges are added to the dancer's account along with a percentage of money the badge costs. Dancers can also give certain free badges to patrons, as well as send pre-formed in-app messages to patrons, and photos of their own choosing.

A dancer must be verified by a venue before receiving any in-app purchased gifts or badges. Dancers can only be verified by venue accounts. Venue accounts are approved and verified by the app administrator. Any dancer app network member can verify another member. Dancers can verify other dancers or patrons. These verifications are promotional only. The venue verification of a dancer is the only verification that unlocks the dancer's ability to receive in-app purchased gifts and badges. A verifications are free. Only a venue can revoke a dancer's verification.

Verified dancers can be sponsered by patrons, clubs, venues, other verified dancers or themselves, using an in-app gift purchase. Sponsering a dancer upgrades the dancer account from basic to premium. Premium verified dancer accounts have more promotion features available to them, such as unlimited photo album for which to share with patrons.

All in-app communication between members is done using pre-formed messages or notifications. GPS or location services are not used, though dancers are grouped by zip code and venue.

A verified dancer can provide a dance schedule, update their current dance status, as well as provide a set amount of promotional photos on their profile.

Badges are in-app purchased gifts to dancers that promote that dancer on the network. Badges of various types are provided and can have multipliers added to them. For example: a patron could purchase a "hot body" badge x 5 for a verified dancer. This badge would increase the dancer's network ranking as well as result in a monetary deposit valued at 5 times the badge's cost.

Patrons can also receive badges from dancers and venues, ranking the patrons in the patron network.
